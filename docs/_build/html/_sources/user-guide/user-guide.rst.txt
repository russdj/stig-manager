   When a Review Workspace tab is opened with a single-click on a Navigation Tree Node, it opens in a Preview tab in the Content Panel. This tab will be replaced by the next tab that is opened. To make this tab permanent, double-click on the tab title at the top of the Content Panel, or edit the workspace's contents. Opening a tab with a double-click on the Navigation Tree node will open the tab in a permanent state.

The menu bar also supports a variety of status and Title filters.

.. note::
   STIG Manager does not retain the .ckl or XCCDF files that are imported. The files are parsed and the Reviews stored in STIG Manager's Database. STIG Manager can produce a new .ckl representation of its Reviews on demand.

This Log tab displays how this Review has changed over time.


Review Panel
----------------------------
The Review panel contains the Evaluation and any required Recommendation info for this Review.

Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Evaluation holds the actual Result of a compliance decision about this Rule on the selected Asset, and the required Commentary. The Results supported are: Open (O), Not a Finding (NF), Not Applicable (NA) and Not Reviewed (NR).

When an XCCDF file is imported, the Evaluation Comment will be constructed out of available metadata in the XCCDF file.

In a .ckl import or export, the equivalent fields are Finding and Finding Details.


Recommendation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setting an Evaluation Result to "Open" enables the Recommendation section.
The Recommendation holds the Action and Action Comment describing the steps the Reviewer expects must be taken to address the Open finding.  The Actions supported are: Remediate, Mitigate, and Exception.
In a .ckl import, the Action Comment is equivalent to the Comment field.
In a .ckl export, the Action is prepended(in all caps, with a colon ie. REMEDIATE:) to the Action comment, as the Action field is not present in most versions of .ckls.  STIG Manager understands this convention, and will appropriately set the Recommendation Action if it sees one of those terms prepended to the Action Comment.  .ckls produced by the commonly used tool STIG-Viewer will not set this Action unless the Reviewer adds the appropriate keyword to the beginning of their Action Comment themselves.

Modified
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The User and Timestamp associated with the last change to this Review.

Save and Save/Submit Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The buttons on the bottom of the Review Panel allow the User to simply Save the review for later, or to Submit the Review, which will start its engagement with the :term:`RMF Workflow <Workflow>`.  In most use cases, the goal for Evaluators will be to get every Review into a "Submitted" state.  Once Submitted, the Collection Owner can set the Review to "Accepted" to lock it. The Collection Owner can also Reject the Review with Feedback, which will be marked so that the

Import CKL or SCAP to Build or Update Your Collection

STIG Manager lets you populate your entire Collection from scratch or add to an existing Collection with a bulk import of .ckl and XCCDF files. This feature will create any new Assets you submit files for, and assign them the STIGs specified in the imported files.  If the Asset already exists, the newly imported STIGs will be assigned to them. The User can also choose whether or not to import the Reviews in the imported files, or just create the Assets and STIG Assignments.

The Asset Name must match exactly. Check the :term:`ckl` and :term:`XCCDF` glossary entries for how their individual fields map to STIG Manager fields. 

.. note::
   When STIG Manager creates an Asset from an imported file, it will populate the Name, FQDN, IP, and MAC fields if they are present in the file. If the asset is already created, those fields are NOT updated when a file is imported. 


.. note::
   STIG Manager does not retain the .ckl or XCCDF files that are imported. The files are parsed and the Reviews stored in STIG Manager's Database. STIG Manager can produce a new .ckl representation of its Reviews on demand.

The "Export CKLs..." button in the STIGs Panel Toolbar will open a pop-up interface with a checkbox selection tree.  Selections can be made for any combination in the tree, from the individual STIG-Asset level, whole STIG level, or every STIG in the Collection. 

One multi-STIG .ckl file will be generated for every unique Asset selected. The package of :term:`ckl` files will be presented as a .zip file.  Check the :term:`ckl` glossary entry for exact mappings of fields from STIG Manger to .ckl file.

A Note on .CKL Processing
=================================

When the STIG Manager Client imports data from :term:`.ckl files <ckl>`, in the simplest case it will attempt to match (and, in some instances, create) the Asset specified in the .ckl's ``<HOST_NAME>`` element.  However, if the ``<ASSET><WEB_OR_DATABASE>`` element in the .ckl has a value of ``true``, special processing is invoked. This processing will attempt to match the ``<HOST_NAME>``, ``<WEB_DB_SITE>`` and ``<WEB_DB_INSTANCE>`` values in the .ckl with Asset metadata when identifying the Asset.  When the STIG Manager Client creates Assets from .ckls with these elements populated, it will populate the same Asset metadata according to the table below. 

Conversely, when STIG Manager produces a .ckl file from an Asset that has the below metadata values set, it will populate the appropriate .ckl elements. 

The following metadata properties are used when the value of ``<ASSET><WEB_OR_DATABASE>``  is ``true``:

   * - ``<ASSET>`` Child Element
     - Asset metadata
     - Note
   * - ``<WEB_OR_DATABASE>``
     - ``cklWebOrDatabase``    
     - When set to true, invokes additional processing using the below elements and metadata     
   * - ``<HOST_NAME>``
     - ``cklHostName``    
     - This value will populate the ``<HOST_NAME>`` element of a ckl, as opposed to the Asset name in other cases.
   * - ``<WEB_DB_SITE>``
     - ``cklWebDbSite``
     - No specific purpose for STIG Manager, other than contributing to Asset identification 
   * - ``<WEB_DB_INSTANCE>``
     - ``cklWebDbInstance``          
     - No specific purpose for STIG Manager, other than contributing to Asset identification 

   
If the importer needs to create an Asset, it will set this metadata and set the initial Asset name to ``<HOST_NAME>-[<WEB_DB_SITE> | "NA"]-[<WEB_DB_INSTANCE> | "NA"]``. The Asset name is not meaningful (to STIG Manager) and it can be changed by the user later, if required.

.. note::
   STIG Manager does not typically import .ckl reviews with a "Not_Reviewed" status. However, if a "Not_Reviewed" result includes data in the "Finding_Details" element, it will be imported with a result of "Informational". Upon export as a .ckl, any Informational results that remain will be generated with a "Not_Reviewed" status once more.
